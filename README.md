# HP-8903B-Audio-Analyzer-software
Software for the HP / Agilent 8903B Audio Analyzer

The Audio Analyzer software is intended to be used with the HP / Agilent (now Keysight) 8903B Audio Analyzer connected to a USB port of a PC via the low cost open source AR488 or compatible GPIB(HPIB)/USB interface to automate measurements on audio equipment.
It is assumed you are familiar with the analyzer and know how to connect devices under test.
The software is freeware but not open source and is written in LabVIEW.

This is a placeholder for now until the software is realeased, currently in beta-test, if you are interested in testing contact me.
